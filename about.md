In this site, I will be writing articles about my two favorite things in the world, code and chips which was how the name came about.

"Code(as in program code)" articles will be about Website, Mobile, Database, Data Science and Chatbots and etc.
"Chips(in hardware chips)" articles will be about tech gadgets, monitor, phones, computer peripherals, headphones and etc.

Planning to take what started off as a casual foray into writing informative articles many months ago into something further. Might extend to do videos too. Lets see how far this will go!üòÅ
