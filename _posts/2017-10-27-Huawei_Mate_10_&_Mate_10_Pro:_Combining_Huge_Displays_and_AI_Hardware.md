After last year’s launch of the Huawei Mate 9 and Mate 9 Pro, Huawei is back again this year with the Mate 10 and Mate 10 Pro. Prominent on both phones, you’ll notice huge displays right at the front, a dual camera setup on the back, minimal bezels everywhere and, of course, the very first smartphones with the Kirin A.I. Processor.

# Huawei Mate 10

The Mate 10, the smaller of the two phones, features a standard 16:9 LCD display which size is 5.9 inches with 2650 x 1440 resolution. It is 8.2mm thick and the body of the phone consists of both glossy glass and metal construction. The fingerprint sensor has been repositioned to the front within an ultra-narrow bottom bezel. While there is no IP67 certified waterproofing and an IR blaster on the Mate 10, it is worth noting that the Mate 10 comes with a headphone jack and a microSD card slot instead.
As for the internals, the Mate 10 runs on a Kirin 970 processor, 4GB of RAM, 64GB of internal storage (expandable with microSD card), a 4,000mAh battery, EMUI 8.0 on top of Android 8.0 Oreo and Leica-certified dual-cameras consisting of a 12MP RGB sensor (comes with Optical Image Stabilisation) and a 20MP monochrome sensor with f/1.6 lenses on both sensors. There is also an 8MP front facing camera on the front.

The Huawei Mate 10 will come in 4 colours: Pink Gold, Champagne Gold, Mocha Brown, and Black, and will be available in Malaysia on 26th October 2017 at RM 2699. If you pre-order the Mate 10, you will receive free gifts worth up to RM 999 which includes Huawei Body Scale, Mate 10 Premium Gift Box, and a Premium VIP Card.

# Huawei Mate 10 Pro

The Mate 10 Pro features a standard 18:9 FullView OLED display which is 6.0 inches in size with 2160 x 1080 resolution. This makes the Pro feel taller and narrower than the Mate 10. It is 7.9mm and the body of the phone is the same as the Mate 10. The fingerprint sensor is located at back underneath the dual cameras. There is no headphone jack on the more premium Mate 10 Pro which is rather odd (what the heck Huawei?!). However, it is worth noting that the Mate 10 Pro comes with a High-res audio USB Type-C headphones and it is the first Huawei phone with IP67 dust and water resistance.

The internals of the Mate 10 Pro are mostly the same with the Mate 10 except the Mate 10 Pro gets 6GB of RAM and 128GB of storage which, sadly, isn’t expandable. Since the phone sports a lower resolution display, we can expect better battery life coming from the Mate 10 Pro. The Mate 10 Pro comes with the same dual camera setup of a 20 MP monochrome sensor and a 12MP RGB sensor with f/1.6 lenses on both sensors. The Mate 10 pro also comes with an 8MP front-facing camera.

About the new Kirin 920 chipset, both the Mate 10 Pro and Mate 10 are indeed more capable at handling AI-oriented task such as online/offline speech, text and image translation, all of which is done within the Microsoft Translator app. Although the Microsoft Translator app can be downloaded on any Android smartphone via the Play Store, the app will perform much better on the Mate 10 Pro (thanks to the Kirin 970’s Neural Processing Unit).

The Mate 10 Pro will be available in 4 colours: Titanium Grey, Midnight Blue, Pink Gold, and Mocha Brown. At the time of writing, the price of the Mate 10 Pro has not been confirmed just yet but it will be coming to Malaysia in November.

#Huawei PC Mode

Huawei’s new PC Mode on both the Mate 10 and Mate 10 Pro introduces a desktop environment when it is connected via a monitor using a cable between the monitor and the phone itself. That’s right, folks. No dock is required here unlike the Samsung DeX Station. To connect additional accessories such as a mouse or keyboard, you’ll need to do it via Bluetooth. If you don’t have a Bluetooth-enabled wireless mouse or keyboard with you, the Mate 10 itself can act as a touchpad and a keyboard as well while in the PC Mode. Huawei PC Mode can be activated with any USB Type-C to DisplayPort 1.2, HDMI or VGA adapters (not included in the box though).

#Porsche Design Huawei Mate 10

Apart from the Mate 10 and Mate 10 Pro, Huawei also released a limited edition Porsche Design Huawei Mate 10 which is a rather premium (not to mention pricey) option. The design of the limited edition variant is said to be inspired by the Porsche 911 car and it comes in Diamond Black colour scheme. It might be hard to notice the difference in looks of the Porsche Design Mate 10 from the Mate 10 Pro at first glance. A closer inspection and you’ll notice the custom branding below the display and a uniquely designed back case. I’ll leave it to you to spot the rest of the differences ;)

The Porsche Design Mate 10 shares the same hardware as the Mate 10 Pro. However, the most notable difference is the 256GB of internal storage on the PD Mate 10. Apart from that, the rest of the internals remain the same from the 6.0 inch OLED FullView Display, the 4,000mAh battery, the 8MP front camera, to the Leica-certified dual-camera (12MP RGB & 20MP monochrome sensor).

The Porsche Design Huawei Mate 10 will be coming to Malaysia in the middle of November (most likely to be accompanied with the Mate 10 Pro) and will be priced at RM 6999. It is said that the phone will come with a Porsche Design Flip leather case, 2 SuperCharge USB Type C chargers, one USB Type C cables, and a limited edition VIP card.
