After last year’s launch of the Huawei Mate 9 and Mate 9 Pro, Huawei is back again this year with the Mate 10 and Mate 10 Pro. Prominent on both phones, you’ll notice huge displays right at the front, a dual camera setup on the back, minimal bezels everywhere and, of course, the very first smartphones with the Kirin A.I. Processor.

The Mate 10, the smaller of the two phones, features a standard 16:9 LCD display which size is 5.9 inches with 2650 x 1440 resolution. It is 8.2mm thick and the body of the phone consists of both glossy glass and metal construction. The fingerprint sensor has been repositioned to the front within an ultra-narrow bottom bezel. While there is no IP67 certified waterproofing and an IR blaster on the Mate 10, it is worth noting that the Mate 10 comes with a headphone jack and a microSD card slot instead.
As for the internals, the Mate 10 runs on a Kirin 970 processor, 4GB of RAM, 64GB of internal storage (expandable with microSD card), a 4,000mAh battery, EMUI 8.0 on top of Android 8.0 Oreo and Leica-certified dual-cameras consisting of a 12MP RGB sensor (comes with Optical Image Stabilisation) and a 20MP monochrome sensor with f/1.6 lenses on both sensors. There is also an 8MP front facing camera on the front.

The Huawei Mate 10 will come in 4 colours: Pink Gold, Champagne Gold, Mocha Brown, and Black, and will be available in Malaysia on 26th October 2017 at RM 2699. If you pre-order the Mate 10, you will receive free gifts worth up to RM 999 which includes Huawei Body Scale, Mate 10 Premium Gift Box, and a Premium VIP Card.

The Mate 10 Pro features a standard 18:9 FullView OLED display which is 6.0 inches in size with 2160 x 1080 resolution. This makes the Pro feel taller and narrower than the Mate 10. It is 7.9mm and the body of the phone is the same as the Mate 10. The fingerprint sensor is located at back underneath the dual cameras. There is no headphone jack on the more premium Mate 10 Pro which is rather odd (what the heck Huawei?!). However, it is worth noting that the Mate 10 Pro comes with a High-res audio USB Type-C headphones and it is the first Huawei phone with IP67 dust and water resistance.

The internals of the Mate 10 Pro are mostly the same with the Mate 10 except the Mate 10 Pro gets 6GB of RAM and 128GB of storage which, sadly, isn’t expandable. Since the phone sports a lower resolution display, we can expect better battery life coming from the Mate 10 Pro. The Mate 10 Pro comes with the same dual camera setup of a 20 MP monochrome sensor and a 12MP RGB sensor with f/1.6 lenses on both sensors. The Mate 10 pro also comes with an 8MP front-facing camera.
About the new Kirin 920 chipset, both the Mate 10 Pro and Mate 10 are indeed more capable at handling AI-oriented task such as online/offline speech, text and image translation, all of which is done within the Microsoft Translator app. Although the Microsoft Translator app can be downloaded on any Android smartphone via the Play Store, the app will perform much better on the Mate 10 Pro (thanks to the Kirin 970’s Neural Processing Unit).
