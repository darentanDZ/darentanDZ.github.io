# Introduction
There were a few things that bothered me when I first got the Galaxy S8. Here I am going to share with you how I solved them.

## 1. AOD Display
Download the Qoo10 app from the  <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.giosis.shopping.my&hl=en">Google Play Store</a> or the  <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/my/app/qoo10-my/id481574284?mt=8">Apple App Store</a>. Register an account on the platform!

<br />
## Step 2:  Get the RM390 coupon
Get Qoo10 Digital/Living Rewards RM390 Coupon via the mobile app. Search for this banner either in the homepage or the product page and click on the RM390 off voucher. Donâ€™t worry if you cannot get it today. The coupon resets everyday at 10am.So try and try again until you get it.

## Step 3: Go to iGadgets.my Galaxy S8 post and use coupon
Go check out Samsung S8 deals in the app. I bought mine from  <a href="https://www.qoo10.my/g/532621692/Q112304469">iGadget.my</a> as they were the cheapest at the time at RM2410.(Now even cheaper at RM2399)

Now just wait 2-3 days for your brand new  Galaxy S8 to arrive! The same method can also be applied on the Samsung Galaxy S8+ or any other electronic gadgets on Qoo10. This is a limited time promo, so do not miss this chance!
