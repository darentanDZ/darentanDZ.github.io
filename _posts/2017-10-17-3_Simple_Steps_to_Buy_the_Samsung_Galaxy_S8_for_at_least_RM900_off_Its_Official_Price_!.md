# Introduction
A few weeks ago, I got the Samsung Galaxy S8 and am loving it ever since. It is worth every single cent with its main highlight being that beautiful, bezelless, sexy-licious screen and finally a phone that keeps up to speed with me. Many have been asking me why did I upgrade so suddenly. Well, its because I found a way to get it for RM889 less than its Official Retail Price of RM3299 at RM2410. I was pretty sceptical of it at first, thinking it was impossible or it was  a scam but it’s as real as it can get. It’s a Brand New in Box Samsung S8 with 1 Year Original Warranty by Samsung Malaysia Electronics(SME). Right now, you can get it at an even cheaper price. Here’s how you can get you own for RM900 less in 3 simple steps:
