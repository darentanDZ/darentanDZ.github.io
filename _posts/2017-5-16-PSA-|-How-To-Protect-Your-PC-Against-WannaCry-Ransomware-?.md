For the uninitiated, WannaCry is a ransomware, a type of malware that can self-propogates(spreads through computers in the same network), encrypts every single file in your computer and has a countdown timer to the time when it will delete all those files forever unless you pay $300 (Â£230) in Bitcoin. Which is a pretty hefty sum.

There's already 100,000+ victims so far in more than 99+ countries(13th May 2017)
