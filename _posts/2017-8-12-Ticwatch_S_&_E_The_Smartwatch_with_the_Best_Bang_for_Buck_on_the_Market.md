# Introduction
All these years, I skipped Xiaomi MiBands, Motorola Moto360, Samsung Galaxy Gear and many other wearables. I was planning on getting a Fitbit soon up until I saw this post on Facebook about a week ago showing this hugely successful <a href="http://kck.st/2veDGbl">Kickstarter campaign</a> being 1900% funded at the time. After studying the products and the company behind it, I backed it ... in less than 10 minutes and here’s why.

# The Company
**Mobvoi**, is an ArtificiaI Intelligence(AI) company founded by **two ex-Google Engineers**, CEO Zhifei Li and CTO Mike Lei<sup>[1]</sup> that initially specializes in voice recognition, natural language processing, vertical search technology and up to last year, wearables<sup>[2]</sup>. They also **received** an undisclosed sum of **funding**(rumoured to be around USD60-65 million) from the Big Brother G himself(read **Google Inc.**) in a Series C round of fundraising<sup>[3]</sup>.

# The Products
Both the **Ticwatch S & E** have the same exact **same hardware specifications** but they differ in the following way:

<br />I decided to go with the Black Ticwatch E as I personally preferred its **clean and minimal looks**. Currently on the Kickstarter campaign’s Early Bird offer, they are going for **25% off the retail price** at USD119 for the Ticwatch E and 3**0% off the retail price** at USD139 for the Ticwatch S. The products are scheduled to be **delivered worldwide** between end of October to November, 2 months after the campaign end date which I think is pretty fast.

The **only downside** of the Ticwatch S & E that I could find is the **absence of NFC** which is used for **cashless payment** function(Android Pay, Samsung Pay, CIMB Pay, etc.). The reason given by Mobvoi on their Kickstarter page comment section is due to **Android Wear itself does not support the NFC chip** that came with the chipset they used in the watches. 

# Comparison with Other Smartwatches in the Market
The key selling point of this watch is that attracted me is that it has all the **features of the higher-end, RM1500+/- range smartwatches** at the price of RM519. Don’t believe me? Take a look at the chart below.

# Conclusion
In short, I think that the **Ticwatch E and S** are the **best and most affordable** smartwatches on the market right now. Delivering the best bang for buck and comes equipped with full range of features. As of time of writing this article, there are only **22 left out of 4900** for the **Ticwatch E Early Bird offer** and **49 left out of 3900** for the **Ticwatch S Early Bird offer** with only 5 days left in the Kickstarter Campaign. So act quick!
