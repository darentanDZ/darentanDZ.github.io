# Introduction
All these years, I skipped Xiaomi Band, Fitbit, Motorola Moto360, Samsung Galaxy Gear and many other wearables. Until I saw this targeted ad on Facebook about a week ago showing this hugely successful Kickstarter campaign being 1900% funded at the time. After studying the products and the company behind it, I backed it…in less than 10 minutes and here’s why.

# The Easy 2-Step Solution

2) Type "Check for update" and and press Enter

3) Click "Check for update" button

## Step 2: Disable Server Message Block(SMB) via Windows Features!

4) Uncheck the box beside "SMB 1.0/CIFS File Sharing" and click Okay button

5) Restart your computer

# Additional Tips
1) Do not simply click on links, open emails or download files from untrustworthy sources. Check the email of sender first. I received several emails from "Paypal" today. They look very real but their sender addresses are not Paypal's.

2) Make a backup of your PC to an external hard disk. In the worst case scenario that you do get infected, you just need to reformat your pc and restore your file backup from the external hard disk.

# Conclusion
Congratulations! You have just learnt how to protect your computer against the WannaCry Ransomware!
