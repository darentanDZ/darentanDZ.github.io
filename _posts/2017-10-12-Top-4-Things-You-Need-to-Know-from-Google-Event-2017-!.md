In case you missed the live stream of the event last week, Google has dropped some major announcements in San Francisco. Here are my top 4 favourite products from the announcements:

As the successor of last year’s Pixel and Pixel XL, the new Pixel phones are back with new and improved features with some compromises (Hint: headphone jack) packed in the form of aluminium bodies with the Pixel 2 rocking a 5-inch 1080p OLED display and a 6-inch OLED panel with QHD+ (or 2880 x 1440) resolution on the larger Pixel 2 XL. 

Apart from the different screen sizes, both devices essentially share the same features as Google claims that “they don’t set aside better features for the larger device”. Since there’s no 3.5mm headphone jack this time round, a Type-C to 3.5mm cable adapter is included in the box. 

As for the device specifications, both the Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL run Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 835 processors, 4GB of RAM, 64GB or 128GB of internal storage, and pure Android Oreo which features a new Always On Display, a newly-redesigned home screen with a persistent search box at the bottom, and Active Edge – squeezing the sides of the phone launches Google Assistant (Sounds familiar *cough* HTC U11 *cough* right?). Unlike its predecessors, both phones are IP67 dust and water resistance certified. The fingerprint sensor is placed where your index finger would rest naturally and the addition of the front-facing speakers are some of Google’s subtle changes.
